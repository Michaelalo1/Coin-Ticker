# Coin Ticker 

## My Goal

The objective of this project is to practice using Cupertino and Material Widgets in parallel and providing a different user interface depending on the platform, and to practice a few other concepts I have been learning about.


## What I will create

I'm going to make a crypto currency price checking app. By the end of the module, Here I'll be able to monitor crypto live rates for several currencies!


## What I Implemented

- Using the DropdownButton Widget from Material design.
- Looping through code using Dart for and for-in loops.
- Using Cupertino Widgets in my app.
- Checking the platform my app is being run on to customise the UI for that platform.
